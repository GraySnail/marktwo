# MarkTwo

_A seamless, speedy, syncing markdown editor_

MarkTwo is a free, fluid, cross-platform markdown editor and viewer ideally suited
for long for documents like notes and journals.

It supports most of github flavored markdown, plus extra goodies like smooth emoji entry, mentions and hashtags
for keeping track of the people and themes in your documents, and more.

MarkTwo is a static web app backed by your own google drive - that means it's as secure as your
Google account.
