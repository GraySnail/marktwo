# Welcome to MarkTwo ðŸŽ‰

MarkTwo lets you read and write markdown from a single, seamless view. When you enter a text block, it toggles to editing mode, and when you exit, it instantly renders to HTML. It continuously, efficiently, and securely syncs your content with your Google Drive, so you can close your laptop, and pick up where you left off on your phone.

MarkTwo stays snappy even for very large documents (tested on War & Peace), so you can use it for long-running efforts such as journals and running notes. You'll be able to navigate those big docs easily with quick, clear search results.

Plus it's free & open source!
